            Manifests the Court of Dreams and expands the Shrine of Maya.

            When the Shrine of Maya field is unleashed, the following effects will be separately unleashed based on the
            Elemental Types present within the party.
        <ul>
            <li> <span style="color: #f53629;">Pyro</span>: While Nahida remains within the Shrine of Maya, the DMG
                dealt by Tri-Karma Purification from <a
                    href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/All_Schemes_to_Know" target="_blank"
                    style="color: #ffd17b;"> "All Schemes to Know"</a> is increased.</li>
            <li> <span style="color: #8a2be2;">Electro</span>: While Nahida remains within the Shrine of Maya, the
                interval between each Tri-Karma Purification from</li>
            "All Schemes to Know" is decreased.
            <li> <span style="color: #4e77ff;">Hydro</span>: The Shrine of Maya's duration is increased.</li>
        </ul>

        If there are at least 2 party members of the aforementioned Elemental Types present when the field is deployed,
        the aforementioned effects will be increased further.

        Even if Nahida is not on the field, these bonuses will still take effect so long as party members are within the
        Shrine of Maya.</p>
